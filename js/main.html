        <h1>Cultural Perspectives AI</h1>
      This project is a website using an AI bot which is specifically to examine an inputted issue from the perspectives of different cultures, which explores the cultural crossroads which exist in many issues.
      <br><br> The website is split into 3 areas, the home page, the bot examining a single viewpoint, and one bot which compares/contrasts two different viewpoints.
      Users of this website can input their question into the textboxes, and submit their question with the respective button. The AI will then do the examining, and display the results.
      <br><br>Our project, made by Sid K., Tanmay S., Pritvi A., and Tanav S. aims to help alleviate a common issue regarding complex issues, which is the lack of consideration for the many parties involved. This website will allow users to see the views of many different peoples, which will help remove bias and create better solutions for important topics.
